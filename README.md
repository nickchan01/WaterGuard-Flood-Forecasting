# WaterGuard Flood Forecasting

WaterGuard Flood Forecasting works with WaterGuard IoT to perform time-series forecasting for predicting potential floods based on factors such as water level reading data, water level change rate and timestamp. 
It utilizes Google Technologies such as Firebase and Big Query using ARIMA Plus model to perform ML tasks based on hisotry data collected by the IoT device.
WaterGuard is a reliable and accurate system that can help people stay informed about potential flooding risks in their area and take necessary precautions to protect themselves and their property.

## WaterGuard IoT GitHub Repository
https://github.com/nickchan01/WaterGuard

## Getting Started
# This will only work with similarly built projects!

1. Create the WaterGuard IoT project
2. Setup and collect data from IoT device over a certain time frame
3. Open Google Cloud project using data from Firebase Firestore and Firebase Realtime Database
4. Upload the code into Big Query in Google Cloud Platform and run the code
5. Perform data visualization in Looker Studio using the forecast data from the trained ARIMA Plus model and query performed in Big Query
6. Data in Looker Studio can be used to visualise upcoming water level prediction and to view past water level history and trends
