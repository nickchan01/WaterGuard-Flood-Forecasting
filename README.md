# WaterGuard Flood Forecasting

WaterGuard Flood Forecasting works with WaterGuard IoT to perform time-series forecasting for predicting potential floods based on factors such as water level reading data, water level change rate and timestamp. 
It utilizes Google Technologies such as Firebase and Big Query using ARIMA Plus model to perform ML tasks based on hisotry data collected by the IoT device.
WaterGuard is a reliable and accurate system that can help people stay informed about potential flooding risks in their area and take necessary precautions to protect themselves and their property.

## Prototype Overview 
WaterGuard IoT is a our physical flood monitoring and alerting model that works in tandem with our WaterGuard application to provide real-time alerts to local communities when floods or dangerous water level rise is detected. WaterGuard IoT also streams data to our Firebase Realtime Database, which uses Google Cloud Platform to predict potential floods using machine learning and update our application accordingly. Built with the NodeMCU ESP32 which can be expanded to the ESP32 SIM800L, WaterGuard IoT is able to connect to the Internet for streaming data either by using Wi-Fi or even celular connection. The model also utilzes Arduino compatible components such as the ultrosonic sensor to detect water levels, alerting buzer and a TP4056 Battery Charger and Solar Panel to ensure our model is continuosly powered. For the housing of our IoT model, we used weatherproof, waterproof and Ingress Protection standard materials which aligns with our use case of being exposed to extreme weather such as high tempreatures, rain and placed in an actively flowing water source. Some materials used for our housing are such as an IP67 Junction Box which houses all of our electronic components including the microcontroller and an PVC Class D pipe which houses the ultronic sensor and acts as a stand in the flowing water source.
